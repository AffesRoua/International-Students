SQL and Power BI project


The dashboard reveals a noteworthy trend: the consistent rise in the total count of international students, particularly evident since 2015. Among these students, the disciplines of engineering, business and management, and mathematics and computer science stand out as the top preferences, reflecting a strong inclination towards scientific fields. Predominantly, their financial backing originates from parental support or university-sponsored funds. Regarding academic qualifications, the majority are pursuing bachelor's degrees, followed by master's degrees, with a logical proportion pursuing doctorates, aligning with the natural progression of academic pursuits.
